  "response": "CLASSIFICATION: Battery Drain\nDESCRIPTION: The log data shows the Home_Load_kW consistently above 3.0 kW throughout the day and night, which is higher than the normal baseline. The Tesla_Charger_kW is active at 7.7 kW during hours outside the normal charging times (00:00 to 13:00), which should typically be between 11, 12, 13, 18, 19 hours. Additionally, the battery is being charged and discharged in a pattern that suggests rapid depletion, especially noticeable with the battery charge values decreasing and minimal to zero battery discharge during early morning hours despite high home load.\nCONFIDENCE: 98%"
